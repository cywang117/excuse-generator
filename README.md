# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Random Excuse Generator

Technologies used:
- Custom-built Markov Chain, using web-scraped excuse phrases in the public domain. Algorithm defaults to and should remain at k=1 due to small sample size (n=~900).
- Material UI, React, ReactDOM, Webpack, Babel for front-end. Mobile friendly design with @media queries.
- Modest natural language processing via Compromise
- Sessions for liked excuses per user via cookies (TTL 1 hour)
